## Write Up/Final Thoughts

_For this project I had my own free reign and decided to focus on API call backs since I missed a lot of class that week and plan on using an API for my final group project. Also, since I am on the back end track, I wanted to play with as much design as I could. I spent 6 hours on Friday building the main components of the app, and getting the APIs to work. I spent the most time on the exchange rate ticker and making the API calls work. I was happy I got the ticker to work, look pretty, display results, and was happy I got the API callback to retrieve the information I needed._

_Unfortunately, I bit off WAY MORE than I could chew. There was no way I could include 3 separate APIs in my app with only 8 hours of work, so I stopped once I got curencylayer to work._

Things I should work on/be thinking about in coming weeks:
1. Being able to scope work and know how long it will take
2. Knowing the proper lingo for terms, methods etc
3. Write a stack overflow question
4. Learn another coding language
5. Find more internship opportunities

Priorities for end of course/after Epicodus:
1. Stay on top of .NET course, no more absent days, be on time everyday
2. Try to get adequate sleep
3. Freshen up on terminology and whiteboarding
4. Clean up GitHub page and projects
5. Take the PHP for Wordpress course offered by Treehouse
